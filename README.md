# phylosim
Set of R functions, classes, and methods for efficiently simulating phylogenies with continuous trait data. Unlike other R implementations, this implementation allows lineages to speciate and go extinct in continuous time, despite trait values having to be updated at discrete time points. This should allow for accurately modeling complex feedbacks between trait values and speciation-extinction dynamics.
An eventual goal of this project is to also simulate time-varying adaptive landscapes that the simulated phylogeny can "explore" throughout its evolution. I have developed ways to simulate perlin noise of arbitrary dimenisonality in R, but I have yet to tie the phylogeny simulator to these randomly-fluctuating landscapes; to do so, I plan on using modified optimization algorithms to make lineages tend towards climbing up adaptive peaks, make extinction rates a function of 'height' in the adaptive landscape, and perhaps even make speciation more likely when there are divergent adaptive peaks for a lineage to explore (a la 'ecological' models of speciation).
